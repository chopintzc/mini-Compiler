# **Mini-compiler**

## **Summary of the project:**

This is the Project for my Principle of Programming Language class, written in Prolog.
It consists of Tokenizer, Lexer, Parser and Interpreter. We defined a couple of grammars and input several lines
of code which fit the grammars. The inputed codes are firstly tokenized and lexered before they are parsed by
the predefined grammars. Finally, the parsed codes can be executed in the interpreter. 

## **Requirement**

This program requires SWI-prolog

## **Features**
* define a couple of grammars
* input serveral lines of codes which will be tokenized, lexered and parsed
* the parsed codes can be executed in the interpreter
